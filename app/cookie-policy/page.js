        <p className="mb-8">
          Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your
          web browser or your device’s memory. A cookie typically contains the
          name of the domain (Internet location) from which the cookie
          originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a
          randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie may
          also contain information about your device, such as user settings,
          browsing history and activities conducted while using our services.

            There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party
            cookies are placed on your device directly by us. For example, we
            use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser’s

            There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies
            only last until you close your browser. We use session cookies for a
            variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our

            What about other tracking technologies, such as web beacons and

          </h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Other technologies such as web beacons (also called pixels, tags or
            clear gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are
            used for similar purposes as cookies. Web beacons are tiny graphics
            files that contain a unique identifier, enabling us to recognise
            when someone has visited our service or opened an email we’ve sent
            them.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Tracking URLs are custom-generated links that help us understand
            where the traffic to our webpages comes from. SDKs are small pieces
            of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web
            beacons.
